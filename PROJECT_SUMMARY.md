# 🎯 Digital Body Language MVP - Project Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Built

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)
- **Complete Telemetry SDK** - Captures micro-interactions (scrolls, taps, typing, pauses)
- **Privacy-First Design** - Granular consent management, no content capture
- **Enhanced UI Components** - Drop-in replacements that auto-track interactions
- **Real-time Interest Meter** - Live engagement scoring with confidence intervals
- **Offline-First Architecture** - Local SQLite queuing with batch uploads
- **Session Management** - Automatic session boundaries and timeout handling

### Backend (FastAPI + ML)
- **Event Ingestion API** - Secure batch upload endpoints
- **Feature Extraction** - 30+ behavioral features from interaction patterns
- **ML Scoring Engine** - Real-time interest prediction with confidence
- **Real-time WebSockets** - Live score updates to mobile app
- **Analytics Dashboard** - Session insights and pattern analysis
- **SQLite Database** - Ready-to-run demo setup (easily upgradeable to PostgreSQL)

### Key Features Implemented
✅ Micro-interaction capture (scroll velocity, typing rhythm, tap patterns, pauses)  
✅ Real-time ML scoring with behavioral feature extraction  
✅ Privacy-by-design architecture (content-free, anonymized)  
✅ Consent management with granular controls  
✅ Offline-first data collection and batch uploading  
✅ Cross-platform React Native app (iOS/Android)  
✅ FastAPI backend with WebSocket real-time updates  
✅ Session analytics and insights dashboard  
✅ Demo data generator for testing  

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && python main.py
   ```

3. **Start the mobile app**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Test with demo data**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && python demo_data.py
   ```

## 📱 Using the App

1. **Consent Screen** - Grant telemetry permissions with granular controls
2. **Demo Chat Interface** - Type, scroll, and interact naturally  
3. **Interest Meter** - Watch real-time engagement scoring
4. **Session Analytics** - View interaction patterns and insights

## 🔬 Technical Highlights

### Advanced React Native Patterns
- **Custom Hooks** (`useTelemetry`) for easy screen integration
- **Higher-Order Components** that enhance UI elements with tracking
- **Service Architecture** with singleton patterns for global state
- **TypeScript Interfaces** for type-safe event schemas
- **SQLite Integration** for offline-first data persistence

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Feature Engineering** from raw interaction events
- **Real-time Scoring** with confidence estimation
- **Behavioral Pattern Recognition** (typing rhythm, scroll dynamics)
- **Demo Model** with realistic scoring based on activity patterns
- **Extensible Architecture** for production model training

### Privacy Engineering
- **Content-Free Capture** - Only interaction patterns, never text
- **Anonymized Identifiers** - SHA-256 hashed device IDs
- **Granular Consent** - Per-feature tracking controls
- **Local-First** - Data queued locally, uploaded securely
- **Retention Policies** - Automatic cleanup of old events

## 📊 Event Types & Features

| Interaction | Captured Data | ML Features |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Scrolling** | Velocity, acceleration, direction | Engagement patterns, attention spans |
| **Typing** | Rhythm, pauses, backspaces | Cognitive load, certainty levels |
| **Tapping** | Frequency, timing, duration | Decisiveness, focus intensity |
| **Pauses** | Idle gaps, hesitation patterns | Reflection, consideration time |
| **Navigation** | Screen focus, transitions | Context switching, task flow |
